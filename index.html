  <h2 class="section-header">My Favorite Place</h2>
  <p class="response">Venice. It is unbelievably amazing and beautiful. Open canals everywhere and you can fall into the water at any moment. I love that only Venetians can be buried in Venice. And once you are buried, your body can only stay there for a certain amount of time before it has to be moved to the mainland.</p>

  <p class="question">What's important to you?</p>
  <p class="response">Asymmetry (in both life and art). Excitement. Surprises. Stillness. Winks.</p>
  <p class="question">What are your favorite hobbies?</p>
  <p class="response">Tinkering, procrastinating, smiling and evading capture. I like to think that I am excellent at all of them.</p>
  <p class="question">What's your dream job?</p>
  <p class="response">Pretty much everything I'm doing now except getting paid 10x more for it.</p>
  <p class="question">What music have you been listening to lately?</p>
  <p class="response">Mostly my husband's band playing originals and cover songs. He recently played an heartbreaking version of In Your Eyes for a bride walking down the aisle. </p>
